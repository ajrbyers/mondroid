# User stories

One thing I try to do these days is justify and drive the work I do by 
associating it with a 'user story' - a clearly defined requirement from a 
particular user's perspective. The number of stories generated is finite but the 
number of tasks a story may yield seems infinite. Stories get prioritized and 
within stories, tasks get prioritized. Not all requirements are ever fulfilled.

Below are the stories I've generated for Mondroid.

* _as a technical person installing Mondroid
I want the default installation to be lighter and more helpful out of the box
because monitoring is often added as an after-thought or while stressed out, causing more stress and a bad impression and we always want to leave a great impression._

* _as a layman visitor to the dashboard
I would expect to see recent outages, the current state of the website and how long it has been at this state at a glance
because the dashboard is all about being spoon-fed information quickly_

* _as a layman visitor to the website monitoring detail page
I would expect to see the data I just saw on the dashboard within the context of the last month at least
because the detail page is about drilling down into the data and getting your hands dirty_

* _as a person monitoring a website for outages
I want notifications of an interruption to reach me via multiple routes
because redundant methods of delivery increases the chance I know about the interruption quickly._

* _as a technical person inspecting raw data
I need to filter and transform the large sets of data I'm encountering
because new information is often revealed by removing the noise_

* _as an admin running the monitor
I need the logic that does the checking to fail rarely, if ever
because the data being collected may be subject to auditing and intense scrutiny_

* _as an idealist 
I want to make the data that we collect freely available to the public and easily digestable,
because this will empower people_
